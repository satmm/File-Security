File Security: AES Encryption and GZIP Compression
File Security

File Security is a simple yet effective project that aims to enhance data confidentiality by encrypting files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and reducing network traffic by compressing the files using the GZIP algorithm. This README.md provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other essential information.

Introduction
In today's interconnected world, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data is crucial. The File Security project addresses this concern by offering a two-fold solution:

AES Encryption: The project utilizes the AES encryption algorithm, a widely adopted and secure symmetric encryption standard. By applying AES encryption to your files, you can rest assured that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unintelligible.

GZIP Compression: In addition to security, network traffic optimization is vital to ensure smooth and efficient data transmission. The File Security project incorporates the GZIP algorithm to compress files, reducing their size and minimizing network bandwidth consumption.

Features
AES encryption for file security
GZIP compression for network traffic reduction
Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface
Support for encrypting and compressing various file types
Fast and efficient encryption and compression processes
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the File Security project:

Clone the project repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-security.git
Change directory to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd file-security
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
The File Security project offers a straightforward command-line interface for encryption and compression. To use the tool, follow these steps:

Encrypt and compress a file:
bash
Copy code
python file_security.py encrypt -i input_file.txt -o encrypted_file.aes -p your_password
Replace input_file.txt with the path to the file you want to encrypt, encrypted_file.aes with the desired output filename, and your_password with a strong password for encryption.

Decompress and decrypt a file:
bash
Copy code
python file_security.py decrypt -i encrypted_file.aes -o decrypted_file.txt -p your_password
Replace encrypted_file.aes with the path to the encrypted file, decrypted_file.txt with the desired output filename, and your_password with the password used during encryption.
