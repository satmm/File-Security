## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data is crucial. The File Security project addresses this concern by offering a two-fold solution:

1. **AES Encryption**: The project utilizes the AES encryption algorithm, a widely adopted and secure symmetric encryption standard. By applying AES encryption to your files, you can rest assured that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unintelligible.

2. **GZIP Compression**: In addition to security, network traffic optimization is vital to ensure smooth and efficient data transmission. The File Security project incorporates the GZIP algorithm to compress files, reducing their size and minimizing network bandwidth consumption.

## Features

- AES encryption for file security
- GZIP compression for network traffic reduction
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface
- Support for encrypting and compressing various file types
- Fast and efficient encryption and compression processes

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the File Security project:

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-security.git
```
2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd file-security/src
```
## Usage
The File Security project offers a straightforward command-line interface for encryption and compression. To use the tool, follow these steps:
1. Compile the main file:

```bash
